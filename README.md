# File Organizer

A lightweight script designed to automatically organize files into folders based on file type. The script creates dedicated folders for specific file types such as video files, photo files, document files, and more; thus, making it easier to manage and access your files.

Features
- Automatic sorting: Sorts files into categorized folders based on file type.
- Supported file types: Common file types for photos, videos, documents, music, etc..
- Customizable: Easily extendable to support more file types or change folder structure (within the .c file itself---too lazy to make any GUI).
